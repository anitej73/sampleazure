### Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for critical systems
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: 24 hours

## Risk Assessment and Business Impact

### Critical Risks
1. **Data Center Failure**
   - Impact: Complete system outage
   - Probability: Low
   - Mitigation: Geographic redundancy

2. **Cyberattack/Ransomware**
   - Impact: Data encryption/loss
   - Probability: Medium  
   - Mitigation: Backup isolation, incident response

3. **Key Personnel Unavailability**
   - Impact: Delayed recovery
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Cross-training, documentation

## Recovery Strategies

### CP-9: Information System Backup
- **Daily backups** of all critical data
- **Weekly full system backups**
- **Monthly backup restoration testing**
- Geographically separated backup storage
- Encrypted backup media (AES-256)

### CP-10: Information System Recovery and Reconstitution
1. **Immediate Response** (0-2 hours)
   - Activate incident response team
   - Assess scope of disruption
   - Implement temporary workarounds

2. **Short-term Recovery** (2-24 hours)
   - Activate backup systems
   - Restore critical applications
   - Establish temporary operations

3. **Long-term Recovery** (24+ hours)
