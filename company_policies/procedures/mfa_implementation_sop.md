# Multi-Factor Authentication Standard Operating Procedure

## Purpose
This SOP provides step-by-step procedures for implementing and maintaining multi-factor authentication (MFA) across organizational systems.

## Scope
Applies to all systems processing Level 2+ classified data per organizational data classification policy.

## Related Controls
- IA-2: Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users)
- IA-2(1): Multi-factor Authentication to Privileged Accounts
- IA-2(2): Multi-factorAuthentications to Non-Privileged Accounts
- AC-2: Account Management

## MFA Implementation Procedures

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
1. **System Inventory**
   - Identify all systems requiring MFA
   - Document current authentication methods
   - Assess technical requirements

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate authentication risks
   - Determine appropriate MFA methods
   - Document risk mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: MFA Deployment

#### For Privileged Accounts
1. Configure primary authentication (username/password)
2. Implement secondary factor:
   - Hardware tokens (preferred)
   - Authenticator applications
   - SMS (only if no other option available)
3. Test authentication flow
4. Document configuration

#### For Standard User Accounts
1. Deploy authenticator application
2. Provide user training
3. Configure backup authentication methods
4. Establish help desk procedures

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Daily Tasks
- Monitor authentication logs
- Review failed authentication attempts
- Address user support requests

#### Weekly Tasks
- Review MFA usage statistics
- Update user training materials
- Test backup authentication methods

#### Monthly Tasks
- Audit MFA configurations
- Review and update procedures
- Generate compliance reports

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Lost/Broken Token**
   - Temporary bypass procedure (max 24 hours)
   - Emergency access protocols
   - Token replacement process

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Time synchronization issues
   - Network connectivity problems
   - User training gaps

## Compliance Requirements
- 100% MFA coverage for privileged accounts
- 95% MFA coverage for standard accounts
- Monthly compliance reporting to CISO

## Emergency Procedures
In case of MFA system failure:
1. Activate incident response team
2. Implement temporary access controls
3. Document all emergency access
4. Restore MFA within 4 hours
