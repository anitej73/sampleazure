- **Perimeter Defense**: Multiple layers of network security controls including WAF, IPS, and DLP
- **Remote Access**: VPN required for all remote connections with certificate-based authentication
- **Wireless Security**: WPA3 Enterprise encryption, network access control, and device registration

### SC-8: Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all external communications
- **Internal Communications**: IPSec or equivalent encryption for sensitive internal communications  
- **API Security**: OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect with JWT tokens for API authentication
